                      description: 'If referring to a piece of an object instead of
                        an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go
                        field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within
                        a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                        (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                        the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]"
                        (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen
                        only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of
                        an object. TODO: this design is not final and this field is
                        subject to change in the future.'
