                    description: "ObjectReference contains enough information to let
                      you inspect or modify the referred object. --- New uses of this
                      type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage
                      when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many
                      fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                      and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2.
                      Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for
                      individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                      restrictions like, \"must refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID
                      not honored\" or \"name must be restricted\". Those cannot be
                      well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because
                      the usages are different, the validation rules are different
                      by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will
                      happen. 4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.
                      \ Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                      during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases,
                      the dependency is on the group,resource tuple and the version
                      of the actual struct is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change
                      it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates
                      to this type will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs
                      embed an underspecified API type they do not control. \n Instead
                      of using this type, create a locally provided and used type
                      that is well-focused on your reference. For example, ServiceReferences

                                  example, if the object reference is to a container
                                  within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                                  (where "name" refers to the name of the container
                                  that triggered the event) or if no container name
                                  is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                                  index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only
                                  to have some well-defined way of referencing a part
                                  of an object. TODO: this design is not final and
                                  this field is subject to change in the future.'
